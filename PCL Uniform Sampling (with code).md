#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

   UniformSampling is the uniform sampling algorithm. Uniform sampling is the creation of a 3D voxel mesh on the input point cloud data (think of the voxel mesh as a set of tiny 3D boxes in space). Then, in each voxel (i.e. the 3D box), replace all points within that voxel with the point closest to the center of the voxel.
